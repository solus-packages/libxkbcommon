summary    : xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard description
description: |
    xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard descriptions, including loading them from disk, parsing them and handling their state. It's mainly meant for client toolkits, window systems, and other system applications; currently that includes Wayland, kmscon, GTK+, Qt, Clutter, and more. Despite the name, it isn't actually used by anything X11 (yet).
